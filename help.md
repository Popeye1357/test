## domain mapping

once you’ve published a project, you’ll have a direct URL, as well as Facebook, Twitter, and email buttons for quick sharing. Click Unpublish to hide your project from visitors.

### before you start

the public version of your project is separate from the one you can edit. If you update the published project, it will display the Unpublished Changes status in the Project Menu (M). To show the updated version to your visitors, click Republish in Project Settings.

In order to change DNS settings, you need to have name servers (NS) assigned to your domain. In most cases you can simply use the default nameservers provided by your domain registrar.
